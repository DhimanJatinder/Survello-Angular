  <h1>About the App</h1>
  <p>Survello is an application made for COMP229</p>
  <p>Survello provides users with the opportunity to do multiple surveys. If a user is logged in, it allows the creation of surveys. Otherwise they have access to doing surveys without creation.
  <br/>If a user is not registered they will be directed to login and in the case of having no credentials, will be then directed to register.
  <br/> The surveys are connected to a database that is hosted on MongoAtlas. It is built using node, angular and the sweat and tears of its developers. </p>
